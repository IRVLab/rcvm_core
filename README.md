# rcvm_core

rcvm_core provides the service definitions that all RCVM implementations use. In future, it may also contain scripts, message files, or other types of common resources that other RCVM implementations may wish to access. 

To use, add this package to your catkin workspace along with the package for the robot you wish to use RCVM with, and built both.
